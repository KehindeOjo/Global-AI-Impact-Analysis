## 📊 Key Visuals & Insights

- **Line Chart**: AI adoption trends over time
- **Bar Charts**: Top industries by AI revenue increase and job loss
- **Donut Chart**: AI regulation status globally
- **Treemap**: AI market share distribution
- **Map**: Country-wise adoption and trust levels
- **Cards**: KPIs such as average trust, adoption rate, and job impact

## ✅ Accomplishments

- Cleaned and transformed raw data for clarity and precision.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Python.
- Built a fully interactive dashboard in Power BI with filters and slicers.
- Derived actionable insights useful for policymakers, stakeholders, and industry leaders.

## ⚠️ Challenges Encountered

- **Data Formatting**: Percentages and large numeric entries required custom transformation (e.g., scaling down values like `10853.2%`).
- **Power BI Visualization**: Some visuals didn’t display due to formatting or settings; resolved through re-import and data checks.
- **Geographic Mapping**: Power BI map visuals occasionally failed to render due to inconsistencies in location data or metadata.

## 📸 Screenshots

All Python-generated visuals and the final Power BI dashboard screenshot can be found in the `screenshot` folder.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `python/` folder to explore EDA and visuals.
3. Open the `.pbix` file in the `power bi/` folder to interact with the dashboard.
