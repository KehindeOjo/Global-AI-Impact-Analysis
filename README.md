# 🌍 Global AI Content Impact Analysis

This project explores the global impact of AI across industries, jobs, consumer trust, and regulatory landscapes using both **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and **Power BI**. The goal is to derive actionable insights from a comprehensive dataset and present them through interactive visuals and dashboards.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Analyze AI adoption trends across years and industries.
- Understand how AI impacts job markets and company revenue.
- Visualize public trust in AI and global regulation status.
- Compare country-wise and industry-specific perspectives on AI.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, EDA, and visualization (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **Power BI**: Dashboard design and advanced data storytelling
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Step-by-step analysis process

## 📊 Key Visuals & Insights

- **Line Chart**: AI adoption trends over time
- **Bar Charts**: Top industries by AI revenue increase and job loss
- **Donut Chart**: AI regulation status globally
- **Treemap**: AI market share distribution
- **Map**: Country-wise adoption and trust levels
- **Cards**: KPIs such as average trust, adoption rate, and job impact

## ✅ Accomplishments

- Cleaned and transformed raw data for clarity and precision.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Python.
- Built a fully interactive dashboard in Power BI with filters and slicers.
- Derived actionable insights useful for policymakers, stakeholders, and industry leaders.

## ⚠️ Challenges Encountered

- **Data Formatting**: Percentages and large numeric entries required custom transformation (e.g., scaling down values like `10853.2%`).
- **Power BI Visualization**: Some visuals didn’t display due to formatting or settings; resolved through re-import and data checks.
- **Geographic Mapping**: Power BI map visuals occasionally failed to render due to inconsistencies in location data or metadata.

## 📸 Screenshots

All Python-generated visuals and the final Power BI dashboard screenshot can be found in the `screenshot` folder.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `python/` folder to explore EDA and visuals.
3. Open the `.pbix` file in the `power bi/` folder to interact with the dashboard.
